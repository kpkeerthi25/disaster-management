# disaster-management

- 1.predicting the damage caused to the humans after the disaster for quick rescue and learning the usaual activities of users.we already have active mechanisms for predicting the damages caused to the buildings since we have previous records of the stability of the buildings.on the contrary my idea is that we could use the advanced ML algorithms like decision tree to predict whether the individual/subject is safe or unsafe.The project collects the data of individuals like thier routine usage of whatsapp,location history,calls ..etc periodically .All these personal details will be kept encrypted and the algorithm runs when the user is in the geographical location hitted by natural disaster.The outcome predictions will be given to the rescue team so that they could act accordingly to save many people.
- this project is very much usefull when the victims are unable to contact 911 or rescue team.This project predicts whether an individual is stuck in danger or safe.so that the rescue team can save maximum count of victim.
-this project could be maintained by government or bigger private corporations so that the could maintain data analysis of individuals.
-now a days almost everyone have smart phones so data collection and data analysis is simple.
